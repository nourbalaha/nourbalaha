## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a passionate developer and problem-solver with a love for web development and programming. My journey is fueled by coffee ☕ and an endless curiosity to learn and explore.

Currently living in the vibrant city of Tokyo, Japan 🌍, I balance coding, gaming, and learning Japanese (yes, all 2,136 Kanjis 📜 are on my bucket list!).

- 🎮 Gaming Fan: The Legend of Zelda: TOTK is my all-time favorite game!
- 🎵 Music Enthusiast: I used to love metal, but now I’m into Japanese music.
- 💡 Always Learning: I enjoy picking up new skills and improving myself.
